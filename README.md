Firstly to run the project you need to install all plugins in requirements.txt. 
Then we need to run npm install to install the needed plugins for frontend part.
Then we open two terminals. One will start the backend part - server using command " python manage.py runserver", 
while in the second terminal we firstly write "cd frontend" and then "npm run dev".
You will see something like this: 
npm run dev
